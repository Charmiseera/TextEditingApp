ðŸ“Œ Guidelines for Working on Issues

1. **First come, first serve**: Issues are assigned on a first-come, first-serve basis.

2. **Comment before you start**: To claim an issue, comment on it first. Youâ€™ll be assigned if it's still available.

3. **Max 2 issues** per contributor at a time to ensure fairness and better focus.

4. If an issue is already assigned to someone, please wait or pick a different one.

5. Inactive issues may be unassigned after a reasonable period of no updates (usually 7 days).
